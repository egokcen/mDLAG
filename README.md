terminology and usage modes. Please cite the above reference if using any
portion of this code for your own purposes.

This codepack includes an implementation of the primary contribution of the paper, mDLAG.
It also includes a custom implementation of group factor analysis (GFA), and—to keep the codepack self-contained—a 
minimal implementation of [DLAG](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00282-5.epdf?sharing_token=hyFsoNFZfDyh-EVI76hoddRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0Nm1Wps5WZ1Nog-dORHPLUG97YnGS0JZBkvhpO7c5pblBICIHRXMKZ04hmmro2Tn12HIbx2e2LrperSJc6bwzqptnPIaVOrqvl8DcloXzDaOBhLlAqzUvwM4uMyl96KvTE%3D), full repository [here](https://github.com/egokcen/DLAG).

## System requirements

This codepack was written in Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc.), and must be run in 
Matlab.

It has been tested on Matlab 2019a, 2019b, 2020a, 2022b, and 2023a, on Linux 
(Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 7.9) and Windows (Windows
10) operating systems.

Note that all runtimes provided below are estimates based on these tests. Your
runtimes may vary.

Some functions rely on the C/MEX Matlab interface for speedup, whereby C code 
can be compiled and used from within Matlab. A native C compiler is necessary
to take advantage of this functionality. Windows users may require extra 
installation of, for example, Microsoft Visual C++ or MinGW. The code is written
to default to a native Matlab code implementation if mex files cannot be 
properly executed, and will still work correctly.

## Installation guide

Simply download and extract the [latest release](https://github.com/egokcen/mDLAG/releases) of this codepack to your desired local directory.

Install [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).
For one script, `sim1/crossval_noARD_sim1.m`, you may need to specifically 
install the Matlab [Bioinformatics Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/help/bioinfo/index.html), 
if it's not already installed in your Matlab build.

C/MEX Compilation:
1. Enter DLAG directory. Run startup.m.
2. Enter mDLAG directory. Run startup.m.

Assuming Matlab is already installed on your machine, setup should not take 
more than a few minutes.

## Instructions for use

### GFA Generic Demo

1. Enter `gfa` directory.
2. Run `startup.m` to add all necessary dependencies to the Matlab path.
3. Open `gfa/demo/demo_gfa.m` (remain in `gfa` directory).
4. Run `demo_gfa.m` cell-by-cell. The script contains directions and descriptions
   of relevant user-defined parameters.
   
With the current data and settings, `demo_gfa.m` should take less than 1 min to
run.

### mDLAG Generic Demo

1. Enter `mDLAG` directory.
2. Run `startup.m` to add all necessary dependencies to the Matlab path.
3. Open `mDLAG/demo/demo_mdlag.m` (remain in `mDLAG` directory).
4. Run `demo_mdlag.m` cell-by-cell. The script contains directions and 
   descriptions of relevant user-defined parameters.
   
With the current data and settings, `demo_mdlag.m` should take less than 10 min to
run.

### Simulation 1: Uncovering directed interactions across multiple populations

1. Enter `sim1` directory.
2. Run `startup.m` to set up common directories and other constants.
3. mDLAG experiments (with ARD)
   1. To see pre-saved results, open `results_summary_mdlag_sim1.m` and run
      it cell-by-cell.
   2. To fit mDLAG from scratch, run `fit_mdlag_sim1.m`. The script should 
      take ~45 min to run.
4. mDLAG experiments (no ARD)
    1. To see pre-saved results, open `result_summary_noARD_sim1.m` and run
       it cell-by-cell.
    2. To perform the mDLAG (no ARD) experiments from scratch:
         1. To use cross-validation to find the total latent
            dimensionality, run `crossval_noARD_sim1.m`. The script should
            take ~75 min to run without parallelization.
         2. To fit the model with the correct number of latent dimensions,
            run `fit_noARD_sim1.m`. The script should take ~2 hours to run.

          directory) and run it cell-by-cell. 
    2. To fit mDLAG from scratch, run `./mdlag/fit_mdlag_v1v2array.m`
       (remain in `V1V2array` directory). The script should take ~16 hours to
       run.
4. DLAG experiments
    1. To see pre-saved results, open `./dlag/dlag_exampledataset_v1v2array.m`
       (remain in `V1V2array` directory) and run it cell-by-cell.

       dimensionalities, selected through cross-validation), run
       `./dlag/fit_dlag_v1v2array.m` (remain in `V1V2array` directory). 
       The script should take ~5 hours to run. 
5. mDLAG vs DLAG performance comparison: Run `./mdlag_vs_dlag_v1v2array.m` to 
   produce Supplementary Fig. S2a.

   methods (Supplementary Fig. S2bc).
5. Run `data_efficiency_summary.m` to show mDLAG test performance as a function
   of the number of available training trials (Supplementary Fig. S3).
